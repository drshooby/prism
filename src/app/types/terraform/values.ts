   *
   * The current set of possible values is:
   * - "replace_because_tainted": the object in question is marked as "tainted" in the prior state, so Terraform planned to replace it.
   * - "replace_because_cannot_update": the provider indicated that one of the requested changes isn't possible without replacing the existing object with a new object.
   * - "replace_by_request": the user explicitly called for this object to be replaced as an option when creating the plan, which therefore overrode what would have been a "no-op" or "update" action otherwise.
   * - "delete_because_no_resource_config": Terraform found no resource configuration corresponding to this instance.
   * - "delete_because_no_module": The resource instance belongs to a module instance that's no longer declared, perhaps due to changing the "count" or "for_each" argument on one of the containing modules.
   * - "delete_because_wrong_repetition": The instance key portion of the resource address isn't of a suitable type for the corresponding resource's configured repetition mode (count, for_each, or neither).
   * - "delete_because_count_index": The corresponding resource uses count, but the instance key is out of range for the currently-configured count value.
   * - "delete_because_each_key": The corresponding resource uses for_each, but the instance key doesn't match any of the keys in the currently-configured for_each value.
   * - "read_because_config_unknown": For a data resource, Terraform cannot read the data during the plan phase because of values in the configuration that won't be known until the apply phase.
   * - "read_because_dependency_pending": For a data resource, Terraform cannot read the data during the plan phase because the data resource depends on at least one managed resource that also has a pending change in the same plan.
   *
   * If there is no special reason to note, Terraform will omit this property altogether.
